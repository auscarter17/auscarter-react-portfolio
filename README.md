  # Installation
  Clone the repo to view the code. When the repo is downloaded, run "npm i" at the root folder to install the node modules required. Once these have installed, run "npm start" to launch the app, and it will automatically open in your default browser window. 

  # Usage
  The default page upon opening is the About page. This gives a brief overview of who I am. At the top of the page, there are several links in the nav bar. Click any of these to be taken to their respect page. Under the resume page, click the link to download a copy of the resume. When viewing projects, click any of links to see that project's repo, as well as the live page itself to see the app running.
